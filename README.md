## An Empirical Analysis on WebAssembly Compiler Bugs

This repo contains the figures and data presented in the ISSTA 2021 submission "An Empirical Analysis of WebAssembly Compiler Bugs".

## [Figures](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Figures)
All of the figures used in the paper can be found in the [Figures](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Figures)
directory. The figures are provided as high-resolution .png and .pdf files.

## [Tables](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Tables)
All of the tables used in the paper can be found in the [Tables](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Tables) directory with the table numbers matching those found in the paper. There are also tables that were ommitted from the paper for space. The tables are provided as high-resolution .png files.

## [Compiler Signatures](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/CompilerSignatures)
This folder contains some of the signatures collected for the compilers in our study on WebAssembly samples in the wild. The compiler signatures are presented for Emscripten, Binaryen, and Wasm-Bindgen, as well as for samples whose compiler could not be determined.

## [Data](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Data)
This folder contains a sample of the manually inspected Emscripten bugs. We provide a sample of 10 bugs in the file [sample_dataset.csv](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Data/sample_dataset.csv).
