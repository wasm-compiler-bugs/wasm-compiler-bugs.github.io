## An Empirical Study on WebAssembly Compiler Bugs

This repo contains the figures and data presented in the ICSE 2021 submission "An Empirical Study on WebAssembly Compiler Bugs".

## [Figures](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Figures)
All of the figures used in the paper can be found in the [Figures](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Figures)
directory. The figures are provided as hihg-resolution .png and .pdf files.

## [Tables](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Tables)
All of the tables used in the paper can be found in the [Tables](https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Tables) directory with the table numbers matching those found in the paper. There are also tables that were ommitted from the paper for space. The tables are provided as high-resolution .png files.
