 <p>This repo contains the figures and data presented in the ISSTA 2021 submission &quot;An Empirical Analysis of WebAssembly Compiler Bugs&quot;.</p>


 <h2 id="dataset"><a href="https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Dataset">Dataset</a></h2>
 <p>This folder contains the samples collected from the qualitative study,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Dataset/qualitative_dataset.csv">qualitative_dataset.csv</a>, and the quantitative dataset,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/tree/master/Dataset/quantitative_dataset.csv">quantitative_dataset.csv</a>.</p>
 
 <h3>Quantitative Study Bug Collection</h3>
 <p> The bug dataset is constructed by scanning the repositories of six compilers, AssemblyScript, Asterius, Binaryen, Emscripten, TinyGo, and Wasm-Bindgen (obtained from <a href="https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm">this list</a>), to identify issues that contained bug reports. We do this using two approaches.</p>
 <p>In the first approach, we use the GitHub Search API to collect all the closed issues that had a label indicating the issue was a bug, including &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;good first bug&quot;, &quot;breaking change&quot;, etc... This produced a total of 243 issues. </p>
 <p>In the second approach, we use the GitHub REST API to collect all the issues from the six compilers, arriving at a total of 96,186 issuess.  We limit these bugs to closed issues in order to reliably obtain information on the bug fix and root cause, which reduces the number to 88,037 issues. We restrict the bugs to those after the year 2015 as this is when the initial versions of WebAssembly were introduced, bringing the number to 64,673. Next, we search for keywords in the title and body of the issue to include, such as &quot;bug&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, &quot;defect&quot;, and &quot;fault&quot;, and to excude, such as &quot;feature&quot; and &quot;install&quot;. This filter reduces the number of issues to 19,335. We apply more keywords to search for issues that are particularly relevant to WebAsembly using &quot;wasm&quot;, &quot;wat&quot;, and &quot;WebAssembly&quot;. This brings the number down to 1,752 issues. </p>
 <p>The issues from both apporaches are combined (243 issues using the bug labels, 1,752 using keywords). Finally, the issues are manually inspected to verify that they are closed issues related to WebAssembly with a reported bug fix. This manual inspection brings the number of issues to the final number of 1,400.</p>

 <h3>Qualitative Study Bug Collection</h3>
<p>We obtain the bug for the qualitiative study by filtering the dataset used in the quantitative study (1,400 samples) to those that belong to Emscripten (430 samples) and contain a bug-inducing input to obtain 142 samples. </p>

 Our findings can be used to help guide testing improvements in WebAssembly compilers. For example, Implication 9 states that the current Emscripten test suite is comprehensive enough to cover relevant APIs but not deep enough to find complex bugs. In <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/9562">Emscripten Issue #9562</a>, the report describes a bug where using the <code>-s MAIN_MODULE=1</code> compiler flag with a code snippet utilizing the Filesystem API causes a type error that passes an illegal value between WebAssembly and JavaScript. This bug should be covered by the test cases for dynamic linking <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/635c4608fbcc34b025267e0b626f3f245296f4e6/tests/test_browser.py#L3425">test_dynamic_link,  test_dylink_dso_needed, ...</a> or the test cases for the filesystem <a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/635c4608fbcc34b025267e0b626f3f245296f4e6/tests/test_browser.py#L4501">test_asmfs_hello_file, test_asmfs_read_file_twice, etc...</a>. However, the bug-inducing input manages to avoid hitting these test cases as the two APIs were not tested in combination with each other.</td>

 <h2 id="qualitative-study">Qualitative Study</h2>
 <p>We perform a qualitative analysis on 142 bugs. We collect the information in the qualitative study through the following steps: </p>
 <ol>
 <li>Beginning with the Columns <em>ID</em> and <em>URL</em>, we first visit the issue page through the link in <em>URL</em>.</li>
 <li>We identify bug-inducing code snippet in the page by reading the initial post and, if need, a few of the following posts. We record the source code language of the bug-inducing input in the <em>Language</em> column and the link to the post containing the bug-inducing input in the <em>Bug Inducing Input Location</em> column.</li>
 <li>We identify the intended functionality that the code snippet is trying to trigger and record in the column <em>Purpose</em>. We list the indicative API/keyword that helps us identify the purpose of the code snippet in the <em>Tested API</em> column.</li>
 <li>We read through all the posts in the issue conversation to find what the compiler developers and/or reporting user found the root cause to be. We also read any linked issues if the root cause cannot be determined from the issue conversation. We summarize the root cause and record it in the <em>Root Cause</em> column. </li>
 <li>We read through all the posts to find out how the bug was fixed or resolved. We summarize the bug fix and record it in the <em>Bug Fix</em> column.</li>
 <li>After performing Steps 1-5 on all the samples, we look at the root cause summaries in the <em>Root Cause</em> column to group similar ones together. We distinguish the causes by where they occur in the compiler infrastructure (e.g. frontend, linker, lirbaries, etc.. ) or by differences in the languages, platforms, or infrastructures involved (e.g C-to-WebAssembly, WebAssembly-to-JS,...). We record the final categories created in the <em>Root Cause Category</em> column.</li>

 </code></pre><p>We find that a bug occurs when using a file
 pointer and compiling the module
 with option -s MAIN_MODULE=1. Emscripten provides a filesystem
 library, FS, implemented in JavaScript that emulates filesystem functionality, and it is accessed
 in WebAssembly through imports. Since JavaScript does not natively support 64-bit integers, this
 is usually handled by adding a legalization step that converts the
 value into a type JavaScript can support. Within the execution path
 to fseek(), an indirect call attempts to pass a WebAssembly i64
 value to exported WebAssembly function of a side module. The
 issue is that this other moduleâ€™s export function has been wrapped
 in JavaScript code to support value legalization.
 The issue is fixed by exporting legalized and non-legalized versions of WebAssembly functions so that function calls made through
 the indirect calls used here can pass i64 values to the appropriate
 function when legalization is not required.</p>

 <p><img src="https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/raw/master/Tables/Table4.PNG" alt="Table 4: Bug Dataset"></p>
 <p>In the second study, we perform a quantitative study on 1,400 bugs among six WebAssembly compilers, namely AssemblyScript, Asterius, Binaryen, Emscripten, TinyGo, and Wasm-Bindgen.</p>
 <p>This study focuses on four dimensions: (a) We study the lifecycle of the bugs and find that the average duration of the bugs is 118 days, with 26.4% of all bugs being fixed within 1 day.(b) We categorize these bugs based on their impacts and observe many runtime errors (37.8%), including crash (9.6%), instantiation failure (1.2%), and performance drop (0.8%). (c) We study the locations of the bugs and find that most bugs are concentrated to a few files in the projects. 47 bugs are found in the component sof existing compiler infrastructures. (d) We compute the lines of code (LOC) of the bug-inducing inputs and bug fixes. We find that majority of bug-inducing inputs (76.1%) have 10 LOC or less. 51.4% of the bugs have bug fixes with less than 10 LOC, and 78% are fixedby changing at most 10 functions.</p>
 <h2 id="real-world-webassembly-adoption-study">Real-World WebAssembly Adoption Study</h2>
 <p><img src="https://github.com/wasm-compiler-bugs/wasm-compiler-bugs.github.io/raw/master/Figures/compiler_dist.png" alt="Figure 15: Distribution of WebAssembly Compilers"></p>
 <p>Our analysis shows that Emscripten is the most widely-used compiler for creating real-world WebAssembly samples. Besides, Binaryen and Wasm-Bindgen have also been observed in the wild. Fig. 15 shows the distribution of identified compilers, where the left Fig. 15(a) counts all individual samples and the right Fig. 15(b) only counts unique samples. There are duplicated samples because multiple websites used the same WebAssembly binary. As shown in Fig. 15(a), Emscripten accounts for 68% (2,434 samples) of all samples, Binaryen takes 31% (1,133 samples), and Wasm-Bindgen accounts for 1% (38 samples). When considering distinct samples, Emscripten accounts for 95% (752 samples) of the unique samples, followed by Wasm-bindgen (4%, 32 samples), and Binaryen (1%, 7 samples).</p>
